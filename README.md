# Soritfy( Waste_Segregation) 
Sortify is an AI-powered, autonomous garbage classifier bot designed to revolutionize waste management. Developed by ECO Mavericks, Sortify leverages advanced AI, IoT, and robotics to automate waste segregation and collection, addressing inefficiencies in traditional waste management systems. With real-time tracking, solar-powered operation, and a user-friendly Flutter-based mobile app, Sortify minimizes human dependency, reduces labor costs, and promotes sustainability across diverse environments like schools, gated communities, industrial parks, and smart cities.

Project Description

Sortify automates waste segregation with 85-90% accuracy using custom CNN and YOLO Mini models, powered by OpenCV and Raspberry Pi Camera. It features autonomous navigation with LiDAR and ultrasonic sensors, solar-powered operation via a 25W panel, and a Flutter-based mobile app for real-time GPS tracking and analytics. Targeting educational institutions, communities, and smart cities, Sortify reduces landfill waste, enhances recycling efficiency, and supports a scalable, eco-friendly future.
